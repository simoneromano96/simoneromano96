# Hi there 👋

I'm Simone Romano, an Italian 🍕 full stack developer. I currently work at Noku, a cryptocurrency startup, and I keep some side projects active.

## Programming languages I love: 

* 🦀 Rust (but sometimes it makes me 😡)
* 🦫 Go (but sometimes it is too naive)
* 🔷 TypeScript / JavaScript (but sometimes it is weird)
* 🐍 Python (because sometimes you just need a script)

No 💩 Java allowed!

## My stack(s)

**Frontend**:

* Vue 
* React 
* Svelte seems promising but I didn't use it "professionaly"

**Backend**:

* 🔷 Node
* 🦀 Rust
* 🦫 Go

I primarily use React (hooks ❤️) and Node and both of them solves 99% of the problems in a good way, but sometimes I miss Rust's enums and match.
